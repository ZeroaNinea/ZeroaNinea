## Hi, I'm Heghine!

Full-stack developer  
I build animated, structured UIs and real-time systems  
Angular • Node.js • Systems thinking

### What I work on

- Animated, responsive interfaces without heavy libraries  
- Real-time app (WebSockets, state synchronization)  
- Clean architecture in frontend and backend  
- Performance-aware UI design

### Main stack

#### Frontend
Angular • RxJS • NgRx • Tailwind / SCSS • Bootstrap

#### Backend
Node.js • NestJS • Express • JWT • WebSockets

Data & infra
PostgreSQL / MongoDB • Redis • Docker • CI/CD

### Selected work

**Animated Portfolio**
A fully responsive, animated portfolio built with Angular
- custom SVG background animations
- drag-and-drop UI
- multiple color themes

**Real-time Chat App**
JWT auth, Socket.io, Redis, Angular frontend

I care about structure and consistency across systems —
UI, state management, backend logic, and even design language.
I prefer fewer tools used deeply over many tools used shallowly.

And yes, I like cats! 🐈
