## Hi, I'm Heghine 👋

Full-stack developer focused on **interactive UIs, real-time systems, and clean architecture**.
I build interfaces that feel alive — and systems that stay understandable as they grow.

JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Node.js, and more.

### Niche

I build interactive web applications and internal systems using JavaScript and TypeScript.

- admin dashboards and structured internal tools,
- custom SVG and UI animations,
- headless CMS integrations and content-driven platforms.

### Current Focus

- Writing about programming, tooling, and DX issues encountered in practice.
- Publishing technical breakdowns, fixes, and implementation notes.
- Exploring independent projects and collaborations across web.
