## Hi, I'm Heghine 👋

Full-stack developer focused on **interactive UIs, real-time systems, and clean architecture**.
I build interfaces that feel alive — and systems that stay understandable as they grow.

JavaScript, TypeScript, Angular, Node.js, and more.

🚀 Currently open to freelance projects and collaborations.

### What I Do

<!--
- Build animated, responsive user interfaces for websites and web apps.
- Develop real-time functionality for chats, dashboards, and collaborative tools.
- Design full-stack architectures for projects that grow beyond "just a frontend".
- Integrate authentication, APIs, databases, and deployment workflows.
- Maintain strong structural consistency across UI, state, APIs, and design.
- Optimize performance and apply unit and end-to-end testing where it matters.
-->

- I build fast, modern websites and web applications that help businesses attract and retain users.
- I develop custom dashboards, booking systems, and real-time features when off-the-shelf tools aren't enough.
- I design scalable backend systems so projects don’t break when they grow.
- I handle authentication, APIs, databases, and deployment — end to end.
- I improve performance and stability so your application stays reliable.

### Current Focus

- Writing about programming, tooling, and DX issues encountered in practice.
- Publishing technical breakdowns, fixes, and implementation notes.
- Exploring independent projects and collaborations across web.

### Selected projects

**Animated Portfolio**
Fully responsive Angular portfolio with custom interactions.

- SVG-based background animations.
- Drag-and-drop UI.
- Multiple visual themes.

**Real-time Chat Application**

I prefer fewer tools used deeply over many tools used shallowly.
Structure matters to me — in code, design, and systems.

And yes, I like cats 🐈
